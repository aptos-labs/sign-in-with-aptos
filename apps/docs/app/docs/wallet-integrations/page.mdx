# Wallet Integrations

SIWA is designed to be integrated directly into wallets using the `@aptos-labs/wallet-standard`. This design allows wallets to check for malicious applications and prevent users from unintentionally
signing forged messages.

<Callout type="info">
    SIWA is still in its early stages of development and has not been fully adopted by all wallets. If there are wallets that you use that have not yet implemented SIWA, we ask that you directly reach out to the wallet developers to request support.
