# Wallet Compatibility

In order to check for wallet compatibility from the `@aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-react` package, you can use the `useWallet` hook to check for the `aptos:signIn` feature.

If this feature is available, the wallet supports the SIWA flow. Otherwise, if the wallet does not support the SIWA flow, it is recommend to proceed using the `connect` + `signMessage` flow instead.

### Usage

```tsx
import { useWallet } from "@aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-react";

const { wallet } = useWallet();

if (wallet?.features["aptos:signIn"]) {
  // The wallet supports the SIWA flow
}
```
